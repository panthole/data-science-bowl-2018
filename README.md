Find the nuclei in divergent images to advance medical discovery

## Evaluation
This competition is evaluated on the mean average precision at different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds. The IoU of a proposed set of object pixels and a set of true object pixels is calculated as:
```
IoU(A,B) = \frac{A \cap B}{ A \cup B}.
```
